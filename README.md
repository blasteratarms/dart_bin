This is a collection of parts that I find usefull for picking up, sorting, and organizing nerf blaster foam darts, rival HIR, and various other bits of foam projectillery.

The GiggaDrok and GiggaMegaDork use a 3/8 wood dowel rod. Print the part and start it by setting it on top and then tap the rod on the ground to seat.
